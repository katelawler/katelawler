    The evolution of the internet is seemingly never&ndash;ending. With technology and society constantly evolving, most people are focused on the latest internet&ndash;related things and don't stop to think about how the social media app they're scrolling through came to be. However, for some, the history of the internet and all of its relics collected along the way are something that can't be forgotten. Kate Wagner, a journalist and "digital native" (as she refers to herself in her essay), is one of these people who refuses to forget. In her essay, "404 Page Not Found", Wagner explores her personal experience with the evolution of the internet.

    Kate Wagner's father worked for the government, which meant early access to the internet in their home. So, in 1998, Wagner logged onto the internet for the first time with the help of her dad. As she was just 5 years old at the time, the search engine was met with her curious, very pressing question of how railroad crossings worked. The results brought her to a simple, basic site consisting of grainy, white text on a textured, black background, complete with a couple of railroad&ndash;related gifs. These text&ndash;heavy, stripped&ndash;down webpages were like treasures waiting to be discovered, and the favorites bar was heavily relied on. Nowadays, a vague Google search will likely bring you the exact results you were looking for in seconds, and you can bet the site will look nothing like the '90s internet aesthetic.

    That '90s aesthetic hasn't completely died out, though. The nostalgia associated with that period of the internet is something that the new era feeds on, as it eats up the old internet like a sort of "technological cannibalism", as Kate calls it. As an adult, Wagner now opens up Instagram and is given options to add gifs and stickers to her posts, reminiscent of her childhood days on MySpace. The app knows that digital natives will love tactics like this, but to her, it's just not the same.

    This is where the evolution of the internet raises qualms for Wagner and others like her who miss the open web and see the new net for what it truly is. Before the internet became something for capitalism to overtake, it was a digital place of true personalization, creativity, and connection where every web page held value to its user. But as it shifted into something to be capitalized on, these things no longer seemed to matter. Kate explains that if a website were to shut down, tech literati wouldn't care about the lost material because "the artifacts of internet life are personal&ndash;that is, not professionally or historically notable&ndash;and therefore worthless". Apps like Instagram and Facebook have greater control over your user experience than you do yourself, they don’t really care about you. Internet rulers don't care if your personal web artifacts get erased, because it doesn’t matter to them.

    I was raised in the 2000's and used the internet from a young age. Because I missed the historical eras of the net that Kate Wagner reminisces about, I've been one of those people who has never put much thought into that history. After reading Wagner's essay and experiencing the evolution from her perspective, I can understand her conflicts and confidently say that I'd be feeling the same way if I had watched this all unfold. Even from my own experience, I've noticed the personalization and creativity decrease in the internet I've known. As a graphic designer, I crave something more custom and unique. I've watched web design be replaced with website builders like Squarespace, and graphic design be replaced with apps like Canva. When creating a new social media account, I sigh when my only option for personalizing my page is a profile picture and header image. I can only hope that as the internet continues to evolve, these things don't completely lose importance.
